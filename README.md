CS5100 - Foundations of Artificial Intelligent
Final Project


# Project Objectives:
* Demonstrate your mastery of machine learning on a dataset of your choosing.
* You will then try to learn something from your data. What you learn is up to you but it should have some utility.
* You will need to use multiple learning methods and compare to each other.
* Then you will need to tune and validate your model.
* Finally, visualize somthing from your data (how/what is up to you).

# Project Description:
* Using machine learning techniques to analyze the S&P500 price trend.
